# Team Reflection Sprint 1

## Customer Value and Scope
In this sprint we have got the customer to reflect and concretize their needs and what they want us developers to contribute to make value for them.
We have created a solid basis and structure for our project, which in the future will give value for the customer. For example everybody has created
a local database, created a file structure, etc.

## Social Contract and Effort
For estimating the effort it has been hard to know how much time the user stories would take and for this week the focus has been on starting up the project
and learn some basis needed for the development in the upcoming weeks. The time spent on this has differed a lot from individual to individual in the team and therefore it has been hard to make a uniform effort estimation.
We decided to have a low velocity this sprint considering the possible time differ within the group because everybody was setting up the same things individually.
We delivered the base for the project as expected and therefore completed the first sprint goal.

## Design decisions and product structure
The focus for this sprint has been building a solid basis and we have not done specific design decisions that contribute to the final product.
Decisions made that can effect the structure and work is deciding which language to code in and what web framework to use, we have chosen Python and Flask.

## Application of Scrum
This sprint has been a soft and a good starter. We have been a bit confused of how to apply Scrum in practise, but learned a bit more throughout the sprint.
The agile practises used this sprint was sprint planning, creating and completing user stories, effort estimation and retrospective. The practises have helped us 
structure the process and get a clear picture of the sprint goals for the week were.
We have created a base for how we should form user stories and how to follow them (by descriptions and acceptance criterias). This early in the process the effort estimation was a bit hard to understand and we can not really understand what it are telling us yet, if it was too high or low for example.
A question raised during the sprint was how the user stories should be formed. If they are only formed to create value for the customer in the ultimately, how are we supposed to form user stories which only has an impact on the developers? How can we structure the development which may not create value for the customer at first hand?

The best practices for learning and using new tools and technologies this sprint has mainly been the use of the Flask tutorial and sitting together and work. The Flask tutorial was very handy in this stage of the process, because it gave us some basics of how we can use the framework and how to work with it. Sitting together and setting up the project was very good because it made it easier to make sure that everybody understood what we were doing and that everybody was at the same stage. We could easily help eachother when getting stuck and we made sure that everybody had the components needed locally, e.g. the database.
