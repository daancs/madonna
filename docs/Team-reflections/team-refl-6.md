Team Reflection 6
Customer Value and Scope
We have a completed a new window for studies, you can edit data from the GUI, logout button, search history is more readable and more clear where a patient is in a study, you can search based on what study a patient is in, added a back-button från search results. You no longer have to search for exact words, so the search algorithm is less specific and more forgiving. You can export the data into Excel. A whole lot!

We will talk to and show our progress to our PO on Sunday as the final meeting before the course ends.

KPIs:
Hours spent on meeting: 6h
Expected vs completed velocity: 44 vs 40
Rows of code: GitHub can't see all of our progress (?) weirdly enough.

Social contract and effort
We completed most of our user stories during the first day of the sprint, which was a good effort. 

Everyone in the team could contribute with at least one user story this week, which you really could tell from our progress this week!


Design decisions and product structure
We continued to review each other’s pull requests, and it has worked great.

We have documented a lot of our code now, so that the next developers will understand it. We have also structured our CSS document more.

We have worked more on what already existed, and improved what we have. Not that much “new” is added. But we have increased the usability a bit this week.


Application of scrum
We have sat together in a room and worked together again this week, helping each other out and sharing what we’ve learned.

We had completed most of our user stories by the end of Sprint day 1, so we added a bunch of more stories after that day. We must have underestimated our skills this week for some reason.
