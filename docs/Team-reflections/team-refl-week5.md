Team Reflection 4
Customer Value and Scope
This week we have completed a log for past searches, a list of studies with all participants listed, an update to our db-schema, an improved and more user friendly search result/navigation and the functionality to open a new window with more information about the search result. 

We have not, as we haven’t before, focused on a prettier GUI of the application. We have focused more on the functionality and the backend of things.

KPIs:
Hours spent on meeting: 7h
Expected vs completed velocity: 38 vs 34
Rows of code: 400 (as of now)

Social contract and effort
We have completed our biggest velocity yet, but we didn’t complete the whole sprint. It was just 4 points we missed, and the user stories in general were minimal effort, considering we did the bare minimum to complete them.

Two sprints remaining! We could do the next sprint about the last functionalities and the last sprint solely focusing on the graphics.


Design decisions and product structure
We continued to review each other’s pull requests, and it has worked great.

We have started to document and structure our CSS-file since it is big and messy.

We have a “model view” sort of relationship between our different routes (Hem, Sök, Studier), with an HTML-file as the view and a .py-file as the model. The model handles the queries to the db and we display it all via HTML. This makes the structure easy to follow, extend and copy.

Application of scrum
We have sat together in a room and worked together, helping each other out and sharing what we’ve learned. This has helped us complete more user stories!
