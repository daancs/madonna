## Customer Value and Scope
Our stakeholders have lowered their expectations in conversation with us developers, and we will in the end deliver a Proof of Concept as well as we can. 

We have completed a usable website, with log in, and a design for how we will structure the database.

This sprint, we spread out the sprint over two weeks.
### KPIs for the sprint:
Velocity (sum of number of points per User Story): 33 
Number of meetings during sprint: 3
Rows of code: 130 

## Social contract and effort
We finished the sprint with a velocity of 33.

Some have worked more than others, but it hasn’t affected the sprint’s outcome. See under Application of scrum regarding velocity.


## Design decisions and product structure
We have created a base template with HTML and CSS, as well as a schema for the database, and SQL for querying the database. 

We feel like it’s early on in the project and haven’t taken the time to ensure code quality, since we are just creating the very basics to stand on.


## Application of scrum
We should start noting what user story belongs to what sprint on our Scrum board. Without them, it’s hard to count velocity for each week in retrospect.

We might have overestimated the time a user story takes, which resulted in a big velocity but not that much completed work, even though we finished the sprint.

It feels like a lot of work to both use Scrum correctly AND learn a new framework etc. We feel like learning and Scrum combined feels heavy and complicated.

On another note: The whole team is building Cortégen and we have realized that we are applying the scrum principles as we work. The similarities between building our project and building Cortége are striking!
