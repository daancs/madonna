Team Reflection 3
Customer Value and Scope
We believed our velocity would be lower this week, and therefore we just continued onto what we did last week and didnâ€™t start anything big or new. We have added functions like log in and a better search-function, which have contributed a good amount to the customer value.


KPIs:
Hours spent on meeting: 5h
Expected vs completed velocity: 31 vs 26
Rows of code: 400 (as of now)

Social contract and effort
We made a conscious choice of lowering our velocity for the sprint since everyone was relatively busy.

Design decisions and product structure
We followed the conventions of fetching data from a form.

We always peer-review each other's pull requests before a merge into the main branch, to ensure no conflicts.

Application of scrum
We did a sprint planning, and some form of a standup in the middle of the week.
