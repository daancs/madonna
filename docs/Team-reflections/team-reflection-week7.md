## Customer Value and Scope
Last sprint!

We have added surveys to the database, more about the specific surveys under “Studier”, dockerized the project, added surveys to the search result, made some usability changes, added so that changes to the database are shown at the home page, added so you can see what studies a patient is involved in.

Overall, we have a pretty finished proof of concept!

### KPIs for the sprint:
Expected velocity vs accomplished: 72 vs 52  
Hours of meetings during sprint: 6h
Rows of code added: 1283

## Social contract and effort
We have completed our biggest velocity yet. Everybody has worked hard and we came a long way.


## Design decisions and product structure
We realized this week that we haven’t done any testing, and none of us have done testing within. We have tested everything by clicking and checking that everything works, but now that our code is more complex we have realized that these methods (of course) aren’t optimal for large scale projects. 

Since it wasn’t required for this course, and testing is nothing new to most of us, we spent our sprints learning new skills within Python, flask, Jinja and frontend in general. Our time has contributed more to the customer value and creating the proof of concept for our PO, and the code base has been so limited that it borderline “doesn’t require” a lot of tests.


## Application of scrum
Overall, we haven’t really had a Scrum master, but we have learnt to break down user stories in smaller chunks, which we learned was satisfying to do after last week when we finished our user stories early on in the sprint. We overestimated our velocity this week, and did probably not expect to finish it all, but we did get so much more done than we ever did.
