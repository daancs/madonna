# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I have looked at different frameworks to use in our application. During this process I've compared a micro framework with a more complete one. I want to
better understand how to estimate the size and complexity of a project. Is it enough with a micro framework or will a fully featured one be too much
and features will go unused? I want to know more about our PO's future plans for the project. Do we need to focus on deployment and make it extremely easy to
setup on different machines?

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can follow the lectures well and be updated on what the course is actually teaching. Research different frameworks, applications and other solutions
that we can use in development and "production".

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have contributed to planing and writing the project scope. We havent really used Scrum yet, but I have followed the lectures to learn more
about it.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Did some research and played around with the Flask framework.
Helped creating the business model canvas helped write the Project scope description.
