# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
We have started talking to our product owner and have recieved the first "wave" of specifications for the project, but I still feel
like our priority right now is to work on translating the needs into implementation details so that we can start coding. We have not
quite settled on what stack to use, but regardless I think I am going to need to learn a few technicalities. As for the agile process,
I feel like I have a fair understanding of it from earlier experiences, but would like to learn more about sprint planning.


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have a bit of extra insight into the needs of the product owner and I think that will be helpful in making their needs more concrete.
Other than that I feel about the same regarding this point as last week.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We still haven't really started applying the method.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have participated in meetings and worked on filling out the business model canvas and creating our first mockup in Figma.
