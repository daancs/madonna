# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I feel that I have a better understanding of the scrum method this week than the last. Something that I want to learn for the total duration of the project is python.


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By being well prepared before every group sesion so that no one will have to pull me forward, instead I can be of help by pulling others forward. 


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I did not take a leadership role this week but instead took part in the work that was handed out. My knowledge about scrum however is better this week



## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I contributed well in our scheduled monday meeting and in finalizing this week's assignment, however I missed one quite crucial meeting because of my work that put me a bit on the back foot.
