# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to better understand our POs vision of the product and their criteria and demands. Other than that, I want to compare different libraries for example the frontend to find out which is the best one to use.


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I do not have much to add to this since last week.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Since the first week was more focus on learning Scrum and this week we haven't applied the technique yet since we have not had our first sprint.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I have slightly helped with the figma mockup but not as much as I wanted. I have also helped writing the project description.
