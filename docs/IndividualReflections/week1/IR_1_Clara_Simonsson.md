# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to understand the Scrum process better and learn how to apply it in a good way to make our structure better and organized. 
I want to learn how to set up the needed parts (e.g the repo) to get started with our project and understand and learn more about the IDE we are planning to use.


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can contribute with the experience I have in using Git, programming and other previous knowledge to help the team learn something new or exchange ideas when discussions are needed. 
To help the group learn something new I can be supportive and helpful during the process and make the researches needed to help them and discuss different angles or solutions.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have contributed as much as I could by being active during the exercises and making suggestions to improve or change our approach to get the work easier and more efficient during the sprints.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I was active and took part in the discussions about the Social contract. I have also been in contact with one of our potential product owners and our team will soon discuss
what project we wants to have and which product owner we will continue with.
