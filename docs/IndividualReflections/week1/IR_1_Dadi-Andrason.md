# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to more precisely understand the Scrum process and how to refine it to get the most out of it. Currently, Definition of Done feels a bit unclear. I want to better understand how to set up realistic and good goals which I might learn when we have done our first sprint.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have some experience in web development and programming in general which I could share with my groupmembers so that everyone has a chance to feel like they contribute positively towards the projects development.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have taken part in the discussions and come up with some ideas.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Projectwise: none. In Minetest I mined a lot of wood for us B)
