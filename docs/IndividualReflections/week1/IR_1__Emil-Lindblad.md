# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I have worked with Scrum before but with no real guidance if we used it intended way, so I want to refine my knowledge and get
more "time in the saddle" while working in sprints. Better understand how stories and tasks are created and planned. Get better at estimating how long a story can take to finish.

Project-wise I would like to build something using some other language other than Java. Apply knowledge from courses like Databases to create a full-stack application.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have previous experience with version control and Continuous Integration, all of which is very useful when
developing software in teams. Knowledge of this and a general interest for a good teamwork is something I am happy to
share and teach the group.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I feel that I have helped the team get started faster by being able to
explain things like Definition of Done, Sprints, Retrospectives and so on.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I took part in creating and discussing the Social contract.
