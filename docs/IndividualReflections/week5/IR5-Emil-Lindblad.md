# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Now that we have properly started writing code for our own features I want to make sure that I follow Flasks conventions and write high quality code.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This sprint we multiple people working on the same user stories, which required me to do some reflection on how I share my ideas and trying to create the same mental picture of the feature for everyone involved.

I participate in meetings and help discussing/creating user stories and reflecting on our sprints.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I contribute towards my assigned stories and try to help my teammates with potetntial issues
