Individual Reflection 5
Julia Böckert
 
What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to understand the new code in our repo, so that I can build onto that this sprint.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This week, I think it’s me who was to learn things, and not the other way around.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have participated in the weekly Scrum planning.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Unfortunately nothing, since I’ve been incredibly sick the entire week.
