# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to understand how to dynamically create SQL queries in Python since we are kind of dependent on it. Currently we have a janky solution that works but is hard to extend in case we need to in the future. 


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I believe we aren't really learning any new basic skills anymore since we are pretty far into the project but if needed I will do my best to help my team. 


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I partook in the starting meeting but unfortunately couldn't partake in the last meeting of the sprint since I became very ill at the end of the sprint.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have together with another teammate finished and delivered two user stories. These were about frontend and backend functionality for creating a user and logging in.
