# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
After having cought up a bit since last week and gotten a better picture of the project scope through talks with our stakeholder, I would say
HTML is probably the thing I need to learn more about. Mainly how to the connection between code and HTML works.


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
At this point I think we are far enough into the project for us to start being mostly focused on programming and developing, rather than learning
a lot of new skills.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I partake in all meetings. I help discuss our user stories and sprint planning, and try to consciously use a "Scrum mindset", even though
I have started doubting how useful applying Scrum is in this particular context. I understand it is a course about learning agile ways of working
and of course we should be using some sort of agile protocol, but I do actually believe we would make faster progress if we were to cohere
less to agile principles, mostly since the time of the project is so short.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I partake in all meetings. I have made progress on the code, this week my contribution was "translating" a filled out form to SQL queries.
