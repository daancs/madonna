# Individual Reflection
This sprint has not been as productive as I hoped. I have had lower velocity than the earlier sprints and not accomplished as much as I wanted, 
even though I have completed the user stories assigned to me. The user stories are done, but with minimal effort, the functions needed are there but the 
design should be more detailed and polished.

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
HTML, that's really what keeps me stuck and takes a lot of time to figure out how to solve design problems. That's definately what I want to lean more about
to help me be more efficient and flexible.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can share my, hopefully, new knowledge about html. I want to focus on sitting more together with my team and work with the project, and in that way, 
it can be easier to help eachother out and share knowledge to help the team to learn something new (and I can also get some new knowledge).


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have created user stories, estimated all user stories (together with the team), being active during the sprint planning and retrospective.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have completed two user stories with focus on the login system. It consisted of both some parts in the backend and some in the frontend.
I am partly pleased with what I have contributed, I could have designed it better, but the functions are there as expected.
