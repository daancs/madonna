# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Since we are early on in the course and haven't decided on what project to take on, I think the most important thing right now is to assess our current abilites
and possibilities to learn, in order to make good decisions on what do develop. As far as skills go, I would like to try out some more front-endy things, like
React or similar, and overall get more comfortable with non-coding parts of development, such as going from just code to something a user can use and using other
people's work, such as API's.


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I don't have much experience of programming outside of Chalmers, so I think my main contributions would be willingness to learn, which can "spill over" to the rest
of the team, and supporting the overall work process and meeting structure.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We have not quite started using Scrum yet since we haven't really started the project. We have done a few exercises though, and I have tried to help making sure
we actually apply the Scrum method and not just made arbitrary iterations.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
So far we have only delivered the social contract, and I took part in discussing its contents. I have also started following some leads on potential product owners,
which will be important when we start looking into what project to take on.
