# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn more about html and how to write scripts connected to html.


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help to document the code I have written and explain the pats where I have contributed to help my team to understand more if needed.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have been active during the meetings and contributed with user stories that has come up during this sprint.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have contributed in one user story and parts of two others. I have created the log in function and connected the different views with some code which checks
if a user is logged in or not. If it is logged in the user can access the other views.
