# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Currently there isn't anything I can think of right now that I feel like I need to learn or understand better.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have learnt a bit of jinja now that we have had one proper sprint with creating views so I can use that knowledge to help the group next sprint.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have done a full user story and the team has reviewed and accepted it.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I did one user story which was about querying the database from the GUI.
