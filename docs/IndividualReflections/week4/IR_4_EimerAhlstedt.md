# Individual Reflection
At the beginning of this sprint I very suddenly became burnt out on school work overall.
This led to me not contributing with individual work during the sprint. I have discussed the
situation with my group and the sprint goals were reached without my contributions.

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I feel like I have fallen behind on knowledge of flask and the framework overall, so I need
to step up my learning game.


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since most of the group are ahead of me I don't feel like I have a lot to offer when it comes
to helping the rest of the group learn.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
As I said, I haven't done any individual work. I have however participated in all meetings and
discussed user stories and work things.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Same as above, more or less.
