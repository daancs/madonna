## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to get better at estimating both my own and the teams velocity and effort estimation when planning sprint.

Continue to learn Flask.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I feel that my previous experience with web apps and HTML/CSS has been useful for when the team has questions or gets stuck.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I completed my assigned user stories and presented my work to the team during our sprint review.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
One of my assigned stories was to create a schema for our database, which I have done and which can be expanded upon with more complex relations.
