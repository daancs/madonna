# Individual Reflection


## What do I want to learn or understand better?
How to stop time. And HTML. And Jinja. And Flask. I was catching up a bit last week but now I have been falling behind again. I hope to not have to
focus on learning new skills, and there will be tasks I can complete with my knowledge of regular old Python and Postgres.


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Explaining things to other people can be a learning experience for the one explaining. I could certainly use some explanations on our framework, so
maybe that's the way I can help the group with learning.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I only had time and energy to attend one of our meetings this week. I do however feel like I'm getting better at "slicing the cake", and that my
thoughts on how to structure the tasks each week help the group. Since I'm in charge of contact with our stakeholder, my communication with them
and the group is important to the Scrum process, and I try to convey what the stakeholders want in a way that we as developers understand, without
loosing the meaning of what the stakeholders have said.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week has been extremely busy for me in other parts of my life. I have a position within the Student Union with a very heavy work load and
large area of responsibility (President of the central reception committe). This means that I, once again, have not been able to contribute much
to the deliveries this week. Other than taking part in sprint planning, I have had basically no time for school work, and when I do, I'm
exhausted and can't focus for more than a few minutes at a time. I hope to step my game up, but looking at my calendar for next week, it will be
difficult. I conciously let my union work take priority over school, since me failing only impacts myself, whereas if I was to not do my union
work properly, it would impact thousands of new and old students this autumn. At least I can say I see a lot of similarities between Scrum and the
way we work in my committee, which is interesting, but not much help to the deliveries.
