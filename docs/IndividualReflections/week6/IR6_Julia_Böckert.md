Individual Reflection

What do I want to learn or understand better?
The routing system was more complex than I thought, and was the culprit in why my user story was completed riiight before deadline. I also want to continue developing my skills in HTML, CSS and Jinja, since I have found an interest in frontend.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can contribute with knowledge about how to show a SQL query via HTML, which was what I learned this week.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have been active in sprint planning, participated in pair programming and completed my user story.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have structured the "Studier"-site on our website and fetched data from the database, and published it. I have sat a lot with background stuff in the database and structured the tables and inserts.
