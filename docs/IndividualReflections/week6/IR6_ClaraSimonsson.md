# Individual Reflection
In this sprint I was more motivated than earlier sprints which resulted in more time spent on the project. The task I have taken was a bit harder so I did not get much done considering the time spent but I really learned a lot this sprint. I have worked with the database a lot which took up lots of time because I have never worked with databases before, but it was fun!

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
For the next sprint I want to learn jinja more, which is used in our html. I touched the area the last sprint but realized that there was so much more to learn which would be very efficient if we know how to use it, so that is definitely something I want to understand more.
Also I still want to understand html and css more, and focus on how to structure the code for this.
The last thing I want to understand better is databases and all the functions that can be used with it. I also touched the area this sprint but is far away from understanding it in a bigger way.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can contribute with knowledge about how to solve specific problems which I have encountered before (or similar problems). I can also encourage the team to sit together and work with the project, so we can help eachother out directly if problems occurs.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This print I have been active during the sprint planning and will be active during the retrospective. I have contributed with setting up user stories, estimated them and choose the user stories for this sprint. 


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This sprint I have worked on the patient view in the application. It is created from scratch and I have started with setting up a lightbox where the information about a patient will be shown. I have connected it with the search result and now the researcher can see more information about a specific patient when clicking on the text (which says something like) "read more about patient".
I have done one user story this sprint, but it was the biggest one so I am satisfied with my contribution this sprint.
