# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to get better at estimating our velocity and how to use velocity to determine how much we can do in a sprint.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can try to help if I've encountered the problem before or assist in debuging and searching about the problem.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I complete my assigned user stories in time and paticipate in meetings and discussions.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have created a sort of search histroy for the database which shows who has search for what.
