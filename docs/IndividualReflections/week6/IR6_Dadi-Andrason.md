# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I cannot think of anything new to learn or understand better right now. 


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Apart from earlier weeks I do not feel like I have any unique knowledge of something new apart from the team.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I realised that a user story could be split up into two user stories so that we did. Other than that I have been active in the scrum process.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I did two user stories. Both were for the search tab, one for showing multiple search results and the other for styling the search page so it looked good enough.
