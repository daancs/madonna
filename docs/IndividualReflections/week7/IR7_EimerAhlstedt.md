# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Since last week I feel like I have worked more and gotten a better understanding of our framework. Thus I don't think I need to learn more at this
point.


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I will talk to our stakeholder before next sprint to learn what they want us to focus on for our last sprint.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have been to all meetings and helped reflect on our user stories in terms of scope and slicing.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have worked a bit here and there this week, with some overall improvements mainly in what happens in the python code. The way the search history
is presented, connection to studies and study progress and searchability are the main things I worked on this week.
