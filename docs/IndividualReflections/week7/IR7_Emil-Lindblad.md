# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
This sprint I've learned more about jinja2 and how to make the connection from input form to backen to database and so on.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I conutine to provide help and try to explain how things work, such as POST requests in HTTP or merges with git.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have participated in all meetings and discussions.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I worked and completed on 2 user stories this sprint, one was more simple which inwolved adding a logout button.
And the other one was driectly related to the stakeholders needs which was to be able the edit the patient data from the gui.
It felt good to deliver 'more' value to the team and the stakeholders.
