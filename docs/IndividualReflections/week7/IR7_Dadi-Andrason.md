# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Nothing at the moment.


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Next week we might be planning to dockerize the application to be able to run it more easily and since I have some experience in that area I can help the team learn.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I helped coming up with new stories in the middle of the scrum after we realised that the existing ones were too easy after finishing them too early in the sprint.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I finished two user stories this week. One about exporting the data from the database into a csv file readable by Excel. The other about making the search better by being able to search for parts of the name instead of the whole name and also some smaller improvements.
