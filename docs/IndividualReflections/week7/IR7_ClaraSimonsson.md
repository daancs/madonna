# Individual Reflection
This sprint I have worked quite hard. I had two user stories in total this sprint and they were not so big but both of them required knowledge that I did not have before this sprint. I were a little familiar with the areas before, but still needed to learn more which took some time.

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn more about the backend and write more code in python. I want to continue to learn more about html and jinja.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Same as earlier sprints, we will sit together and work and share the knowledge we have.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have been active during our meetings. We have sprint planned, estimated user stories, etc, etc.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have helped with structuring our css-file, which was quite a mess! I have removed unused stuff and moved code that belongs together.
I have also structured and fixed the patient view to be more readable.
