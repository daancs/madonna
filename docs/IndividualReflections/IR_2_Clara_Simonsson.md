# Individual Reflection
Since the last time I have gained a better understanding of the Scrum process, especially the meaning of many key words and concepts 
which has helped me be more prepared for the sprints upcoming.
We have not started setting up the project yet, but I have researched about the different, compared IDEs' we are considering to use.

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to understand what the vision regarding our product are by the PO's and what they want us to achieve to help them. 
I consider it hard to understand exactly what they want and I want to get a clear picture to be able to help them as much as possible.
I want to learn how to set up and plan a sprint, and also how we can evaluate the sprint to learn us more about how we work together as a team.


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?



## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?



## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
