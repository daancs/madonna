# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to get better at defining stories and how one should split them into tasks.
Learn if stories must deliver some value to the customer or if a story can be
for the developers value. Continue to use and learn more python and flask.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I feel that my "soft skills" related to development and programming is of great help
and made me able to explain and help the team with different problems and challenges.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have contributed with creating stories and effort estimation for these. I held this
weeks sprint retrospective using my previous knowledge of these.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Done more research and learning about Flask and how to connect a PostgreSQL database
to it. I have helped the rest of the team with installing relevant software and
configuring their development tools and environments
