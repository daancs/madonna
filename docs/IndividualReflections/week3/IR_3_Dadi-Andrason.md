# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn the visual and frontend aspect of flask. I believe it is called Jinja or something like that and I think it is kind of alike another language I've used in the past called Slim.
Another thing I want to learn is to make stories and tasks informative enough so that my colleagues understand what the story/task is about and could easier pick it up and solve it.


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since I might have some knowledge on Jinja due to me knowing a similar language I could help the team get a much smoother start to the frontend aspect.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have helped writing some user stories but also helped assigning some stories to the correct epics so that we know what part of the application the story is about. 


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have helped in understanding how flask works and also tried to understand how to use the database with flask. I have also been very adamant about using a standard for git branches and naming and such so that we minimise the risks of merge conflicts etc.
