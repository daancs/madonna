# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to improve my understanding of the application of Scrum, e.g. writing good user stories, getting to know more about how to structure tasks not directly
related to final product but more administrative tasks, estimating velocity and better understanding of Scrum roles.


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I don't feel like I have anything new to say here since last week.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Taking part in discussions and writing user stories. Helping to fomrulate questions that we need to answer to apply Scrum properly.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
In terms of coding, this week we did pretty much the same things across the team, working with setup and installing things needed for our framework. We all
helped eachother work through tutorials. I also took part in all meetings where we discussed our deliverables.
