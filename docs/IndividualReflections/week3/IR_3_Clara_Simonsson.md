# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn more about Python and Flask and implement it in our project.
For the Scrum process I want to understand more about the main responsible of being a scrum master since I can not understand what specific responsible/work
the person has/does differing from the team's contribute during e.g. sprint planning etc.


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Same as the weeks before.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have made a couple of user stories and worked toward them during the sprint. I have also made some ethics for the project in overall.
I have been active during the sprint planning and retrospective.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have completed the Flask tutorial where I learned a lot about databases, python, etc. which will help me a lot in the upcoming weeks.
I got the Hello, World! example displaying on my screen and I now have a local database on my computer.
