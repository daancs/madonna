# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
More advanced CSS, and also inheritance in HTML. I see now that I could've used inheritance in a parts of my code.


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I've just learned some new CSS-tools that I can teach someone else!


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have as usual contributed to creating the backlog, structuring the assignments into user stories and estimated story points.
I have completed two user stories.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have fetched data from the database and displayed it, as well as making the page about Studies more structured, but mostly I've sat and made bug fixes to the database.
