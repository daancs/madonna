# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
This is the last sprint and therefore there isn't anything I want to really learn or understand better.


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since this is the last sprint there really isn't anything more to learn. 


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have contributed to various stories and such. Nothing out of the ordinary.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I dockerized the application.
