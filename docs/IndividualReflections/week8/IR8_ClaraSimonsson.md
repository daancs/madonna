# Individual Reflection
In this sprint I had some more trouble than the ones before. The things I did in the project was very similar to the things I had done before, 
but they were a little more complicated which made it took longer time than I expected. I learned a lot though, especially about Jinja.

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Since this was the last sprint I don't have anything to learn according to the project, but I still want to learn more about Python and different frameworks.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
-

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have been active during the planning, evaluation and meetings in general.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have completed one user story, which focused on the patient view and information. It was one of the biggest user stories for this sprint so I am happy that I
had time to complete it. I structured the view a lot and also made some answers Swedish instead of English. I added a whole section with new information from the
database.
