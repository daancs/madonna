# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
This sprint I've struggled a bit with displaying data in json format in jinja2. Managed to come up with a "good" enough solution.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
