# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
This sprint I've struggled a bit with displaying data in json format in jinja2. Managed to come up with a "good" enough solution.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I enjoy sitting together and working on the code. Which means that you can just throw out a question to the group and get help quickly.
I help my teammates by explaining the problem and how to solve it, trying to use analogies when applicable.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I contribute to my user stories and participate in meetings and discussions.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I feel that I added more core customer value by creating a changelog that show who made a change to the patient data and display the new and old values. This was
very tricky to display in the way I wanted, and its still not at the level of "userfriendlyness" that I would like. But its good enough for this sprint.
