# Individual Reflection

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Since this was the final sprint of development it's too late to learn new things that can be applied to the project. I feel like in the end, I
learned a fair bit of new things, mainly htrough trial and error and looking at code examples. The final things I feel I didn't learn was the delivery
part: how to turn our code into something that a customer can use.


## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Same as above, this was the final sprint and there is no more time for learning within the project.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
As usual, I have participated in the meetings where we have discussed our sprints, both planning and evaluation. I probably haven't said it explicitly
before, but I have been the product owner during the project and handled connection with our stakeholder. This sprint in particular, my talks with the
stakeholder has more or less completely determined our planning for the sprint. 

One thought is that when you look at my contributions on github is that it seems like I did all my work at the end. I think it's somewhat misleading,
because the tasks I have completed have been of different types, and some have required more effort per line of code, whereas some tasks had me
copy pasting dozens of lines in a few seconds. This was the case towards the end, meaning my contributed lines of code increased dramatically towards
the end.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have completed my tasks, which took longer than excpected, but I have put in a lot effort this week and provided a feature which the stakeholder
really wanted.
